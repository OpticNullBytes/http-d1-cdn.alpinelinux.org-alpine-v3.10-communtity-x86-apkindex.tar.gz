New stuff:
- Multiple windows on iOS 13! Open the app switcher and tap iSH in the dock to reveal a completely undiscoverable + button which creates a new window. You can even put two windows side by side!
- Font picker lets you select any installed font (though I think the only way to install them is through configuration profiles)
- DNS settings will be automatically synced with iOS whenever the network changes
- Settings icon is now a gear on iOS 13, thanks to SF Symbols

Fixed bugs:
- sudo thinking you're not at a tty
- gem install crashing from stack smashing
- Toolbar sometimes overlaying the terminal when a hardware keyboard is attached
